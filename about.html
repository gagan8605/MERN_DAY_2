    <h2><p>
        Hey , Welcome <br>
        Happy To See You Here. <br>
        I’m <b>Gagan</b> , currently pursuing a Bachelor of Engineering in IT at PDEA’s College of Engineering, Pune, under Pune University. I’m in my third year, having started my journey in <b>2022</b>. I scored 8.30 SGPA in my second year. <br>
        I come from a hardworking family. My father is a farmer, and my mother is a homemaker. I have an elder brother who is differently-abled. <br>
        I’m passionate about <b>cricket</b>, both playing and watching. My all-time favorite player is MS Dhoni, the legendary former captain of the Indian Cricket Team. I also love playing <b>chess</b>, a game that challenges the mind. One of my inspirations in chess is Gukesh Dommaraju, the youngest chess world champion in 2024. <br>
        Apart from sports, I enjoy adventures like climbing peaks and exploring historic places. Traveling teaches me so much about culture, history, and life. <br> 
        I’m an <b>AI enthusiast</b> and love working with various tools to make my day-to-day activities smarter and more efficient.</p></h2>
